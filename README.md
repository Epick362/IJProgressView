Swift ProgressView
==================

A simple progress view written in Swift.

The original code was take from my friend Eranga's [Coderwall](https://coderwall.com/p/su1t1a). It had some issues so I modified it. My plan is to keep improving it.


#### Known Bugs
* When the view controller is embedded inside a `UINavigationController`, the overlay view doesn't cover the navigation bar.

#### Todo
* Allow customization.
* Support landscape orientation.
